"contentHtml": "<p>A good supplement plan is simple. Start by listing your top one or two goals. From there, choose only a few ingredients with the best evidence for those goals, and schedule them consistently. Consider potential interactions and typical upper intake limits (ULs). When in doubt, keep doses conservative and involve a clinician for personal guidance.</p><h2>1) Pick your goals</h2><p>Sleep, energy, focus, muscle recovery, longevity, or immunity — choose up to two to keep the plan focused.</p><h2>2) Keep the stack lean</h2><p>Fewer items are easier to follow and less likely to overlap.</p><h2>3) Be consistent</h2><p>Most supplements work with steady use over weeks rather than one‑off doses.</p>"
